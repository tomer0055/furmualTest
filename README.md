# FormulaTest

## How to Run:
- **OS:** Windows  
- **Required Libraries:** `os`, `csv`, `scipy.interpolate`, `math`,`matplotlib.pyplot` 
- To run the project, use the following command:



- Default behavior: Select option 1 to run with the provided file.  
- To run with a different file, select option 2 and provide the file path when prompted.  

## Approach:
1. Plotted all points on a graph with labels to visualize their positions and paths.
2. Implemented an initial solution ("casualRoute") by:
 - Sorting points by distance to ensure alignment.
 - Finding the midpoint between left and right cones to define a basic path.
3. Enhanced the "casualRoute" by smoothing curves:
 - Checked curvature by comparing slopes of consecutive points.
 - Added extra points to smooth sharp curves.
4. Improved the solution using a library for interpolation, while retaining the original logic for visibility and comparison.

## Reasons to Join the Team:
I am passionate about learning new things and finding innovative solutions to challenges. Joining this team would make my experience as a student more enriching and exciting. The opportunity to contribute to building an electric car is thrilling, and I believe I can bring creativity and dedication to the process. I’m also drawn to the fun and collaborative environment of Formula projects, which I’m eager to be a part of.
